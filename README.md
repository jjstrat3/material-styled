# material-styled

This project is very much in a initial/WIP state.

I've started the project for two reasons:

1.  A new found love for [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and seeing a lack of a good UI-kit that uses it
2. A frusteration over the existing material-themed React library options

I probably won't accept PR's or contributors in the short-term, but please don't hesitate to reach out or file an issue if you have some thoughts and/or ideas.  I've started this to address our needs at work, so that will be the initial driver for this.
However, my intent is to eventually open this up to the broader community for improvement and collaboration!
